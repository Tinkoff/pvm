# Full example:

# define a release type for all packages
release-type = "major"

# release types for specific packages (overrides release type which calculated from commit messages)
[release-types]
major = [
  '@pvm/plugin-*',
  'test-a',

# release type could be a string also
minor = 'test-b'
patch = [ 'foo', 'bar' ]

# choose for which packages we should update dependants
[[update-dependants-for]]
match = [
  'boxy-*',
  'text-a',
]
# as-dep means take same release type which has a dependency of package
release-type = 'as-dep'

# you can choose different release types for different packages
# upper entries have highest priority
# if there are multiple packages matched for single match with release-type=as-dep, highest release-type will be selected
[[update-dependants-for]]
match = [ 'boxy-*' ]
release-type = 'as-dep'

[[update-dependants-for]]
match = [ 'test-a' ]
release-type = 'minor'

# also there is short form possible for same entry
# in this case release type will be taken from config.update.dependants_release_type
update-dependants-for = [
  'boxy-*',
  'test-a',

# include additional packages for updating
[force-release]
