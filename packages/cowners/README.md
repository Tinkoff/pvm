# @pvm/cowners

A library for working with CODEOWNERS file.

## Usage

```js
const {readCodeOwners} = require('packages/cowners/lib/cowners')

async function main() {
  const codeOwners = await readCodeOwners()
}
```

## Interfaces

### `OwnersEntry`

Structure which holds each valid line with pattern and owners in CODEWNERS file.
Here is typescript definition:

```typescript
interface OwnersGroup {
  attrs: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>,
  pattern: string,
  owners: string[],
  match(path: string): boolean,
}
```

Where `attrs` are being parsed from shebang comments.
Example shebang comment with all available cases:

```
#! int=4 str='cat\'s ball' new=false old=true greet="hello world!" vs=null
* @owners
```
